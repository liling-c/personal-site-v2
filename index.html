            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website. I'm a recent graduate from Boston University who somehow stumbled her way into
                becoming a programmer. As a kid, I spent my time drawing and folding origami. I told my parents that I
                wanted to be an artist when I grew up; my interest in programming began with a happy accident. In 10th
                grade, I was placed into a programming class instead of the drawing elective I requested. I
                wondered, "What is programming?" I attended it and haven't looked back. I look forward to what new
                things I'll gain each day and hope to acquire the necessary skills to combine all my interests into one
                project.</p>
            <p> Today, I'm a recent graduate of Boston University with a B.A. in Computer Science
                and a Teaching Assistant (TA) for Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program. In my spare time, when I'm
                not staring at a code editor, I enjoy drawing (read: staring at a blank piece of paper) and hoarding
                stationery.</p>
            <p>Here are a few of my past courses:</p>
            <ul id="course-list">
                <li>Mobile App Development</li>
                <li>Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms</li>
                <li>Introduction to Information Security</li>
                <li>Probability in Computing</li>
                <li>Fundamentals of Computing Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And a few technologies I have been working with recently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>
