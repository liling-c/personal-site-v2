            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my website. I'm a recent graduate from Boston University who somehow stumbled her way into
                becoming a programmer. As a kid, I spent my time drawing and folding origami. I told my parents I
                wanted to be an artist when I grew up; my interest in programming began with a happy accident. In 10th
                grade, I was placed into a programming class instead of the drawing elective I requested. I
                wondered, "What is programming?" I attended it and haven't looked back.</p>
            <p>I look forward to what new things I'll gain each day and hope to acquire the necessary skills to combine
                all my interests into one project. In my spare time, when I'm not staring at a code editor, I enjoy
                playing Genshin Impact, drawing (read: staring at a blank piece of paper) and hoarding stationery.</p>
            <p>Here are a few of my past courses:</p>
            <ul id="course-list">
                <li>Mobile App Development</li>
                <li>Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms</li>
                <li>Introduction to Information Security</li>
                <li>Probability in Computing</li>
                <li>Fundamentals of Computing Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And a few technologies I have been working with recently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Work Experience.</h2>
            <p><b>Teaching Assistant</b> | Girls Who Code | Jun 2022 - Aug 2022</p>
            <p>In this role, I helped teach a class of 60 students, look over student projects, assist them with
                debugging, and connect with a smaller set of students outside of class. I hope I was able to inspire the
                next generation of students to love computer science and let them know that they belong here.</p>
            <p><b>Technical Consultant</b> | Boston University IT Help Center | Sep 2018 - Mar 2020</p>
            <p>As a technical consultant, I interacted with faculty and students experiencing issues with their personal
                devices or university accounts. By resolving their difficulties and documenting the solution I used, I
                could not only allow them to continue their work but also help my colleagues with other clients who may
                experience the same problems.</p>
            <p><b>Student Intern</b> | Orange County Public Schools | Jun 2017 - Jul 2017</p>
            <p>This was my first ever job and first real introduction to the world of computers. I learned not only
                about basic methods to maintain the functionality of the laptops and desktops I worked with. I also
                learned about the effort the school technicians put into keeping my school district's then-fledgling
                school-provided device program running smoothly.</p>

            <h2>What's Next.</h2>
            <p>I am currently actively seeking job opportunities in the New York area. While I may not know what my
                future job may entail, I look forward to learning new skills. At the same time, I am working on some
                personal projects I've had in my idea bin and learning some other coding languages!</p>
