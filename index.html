            <h1>Hi,<br>I'm Lisa Chen.</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website.<br>I'm a budding mobile and Android developer who somehow stumbled upon this path
                in life. (I was placed into a programming class instead of the drawing elective I requested and stuck
                with it out of love and curiosity.) I look forward to what new things I'll gain each day and hope to
                acquire the necessary skills to combine all my interests into one project.</p>

            <h2>About Me.</h2>
            <p>My interest in programming began as a happy accident. In 10th grade, I was placed into a programming
                class instead of the drawing elective I requested. I wondered, "What is programming?" I attended it and
                haven't looked back. Today, I'm a recent graduate of Boston University with a B.A. in Computer Science
                and a TA for Girls Who Code's Summer Immersion Program.</p>
            <p>Here are a few of my past courses:</p>
            <ul id="course-list">
                <li>Mobile App Development</li>
                <li>Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms</li>
                <li>Introduction to Information Security</li>
                <li>Probability in Computing</li>
                <li>Fundamentals of Computing Systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>And a few technologies I have been working with recently:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Node.js</li>
            </ul>
